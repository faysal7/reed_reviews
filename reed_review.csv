Office Receptionist Course - CPD Accredited,"The course itself was insightful and I did leave with something useful. Alot of the materials were repeated from one section to another. Some of the videos were not available and some do not link with section. Worst - exam queations. 30% was on Microsoft Office - not covered in material. Another 30-40% was on the case studies - 3 major sections 12 modules. Memory or test on what learnt from actual course.

Online Nail Technician Diploma - CPD Accredited,"Don’t waste your time on this course, it’s a load of rubbish with a few dodgy videos on YouTube chucked in for good measure.

Health and Safety Executive Training - CPD Accredited,I gave this 3 stars for value because it was discounted to £8.99 the course content most of it copy and pasted from professional sites. The parts that were written in house were very poorly written with bad grammar and context.

Over all disappointed and left me wondering why this would be credited by any body CPD?,1.6,one_education
